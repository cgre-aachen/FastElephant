# FastElephant

## General
The package FastElephant provides additional material for the MOOSE-based application DwarfElephant. We provide inside the folder `Coupling` example scripts and tutorials to couple the surrogate models generated with the DwarfElephant package to other external libraries. Furthermore, in the folder `FileOperations` we provide scripts for an automated modification of the MOOSE input files and a reading function for matrices and vectors from DwarfElephant to Python. Inside the folder `PreProcessing` you can find a script for the symmetrizing matrices. The `ReducedBasis` folder contains a python version of the online stage of the reduced basis method based on the implementation in DwarfElephant.
